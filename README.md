# odin-recipes

## The first project made following the Odin Project curriculum!

This project is a very basic website with links to three different recipe pages. Each recipe page includes an image, a short description of the recipe, an unordered Ingredients list, and an ordered Directions list. Each recipe page also includes a link back to the home page that lists all of the recipes.

In addition to learning basic HTML tags and document structuring, I've also been learning my way around Linux and a command line interface. I have the Github extensions installed in VS Code, but I am forcing myself to not only commit and push via the command line, but also navigate through the folders and create new files.
