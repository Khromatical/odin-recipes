        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This recipe comes from John Mitzewich on <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/223042/chicken-parmesan/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Allrecipes</a> and was designed to stay crispy by using sauce on top of the chicken only!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
            <li>salt and ground pepper</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
            <li>3/4ths cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup olive oil for frying</li>
            <li>1/2 cup tomato sauce</li>
            <li>1/4th cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>
            <li>1/4th cup chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated provolone cheese</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather the ingredients and preheat the oven to 450 degrees F.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic and pound to a thickness of 1/2-inch.</li>
            <li>Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over breasts with a sifter or strainer until both sides are evenly coated.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside. Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl and set aside.</li>
            <li>Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in bowl of beaten eggs, then press in the bread crumb mixture until both sides are evenly coated. Repeat for each breast, then let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Heat 1/2 cup olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it starts to shimmer. Cook chicken in oil until golden, or about 2 minutes per side. The rest of the cooking will be done in the oven.</li>
            <li>Transfer chicken to a baking dish and top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.</li>
            <li>Layer mozzarella, provolone cheeses and fresh basil over each chicken breast in equal amounts. Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil each breast.</li>
            <li>Bake until cheese is brown and bubbly and chicken is no longer pink in the center (15-20 minutes). A thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F.</li>
        </ol>
